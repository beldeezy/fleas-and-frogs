# Fleas & Frogs 🐸  
A local-first productivity system built for clarity, momentum, and meaningful work.

Fleas & Frogs is a keyboard-first, offline-friendly planning tool that helps you move through your tasks with purpose — eliminating clutter, reducing friction, and giving you a simple way to plan your days, weeks, and projects.

## 🚀 Vision
A focused, local-first to-do planner that feels fast, reliable, and effortless — even offline.  
Build for people who want fewer distractions and more momentum.

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- **Next.js + TypeScript**
- **Local-first data** with IndexedDB (Dexie)
- **Lightweight UI** (shadcn/ui or minimal custom components)
- **Zero backend to start** (fully client-side MVP)
